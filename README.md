Campbell Vertesi - the manager readme
===

This document is an introduction to me as a manager. It seems unfair to throw someone into a new situation with a manager, and expect them to just "figure it out as they go". I hope that this helps to make that experience a little easier.

If you have questions, suggestions, or if you just disagree with how I present myself here, please submit an Issue, PR, or just let me know. I've never had me as a manager, so your feedback is very helpful!

Finally, this is not a hard and fast set of "rules." This document should set expectations, not define rigid requirements. The ultimate guide is the one we build through experience working together.


Me as a human
---

I'm a learning addict, stubborn problem solver, opera singer, parent of 3, and a martial arts practitioner. In my career I've been a computer repair guy, business owner, sysadmin, web frontend developer, web backend developer, CTO, and technical manager. I take a very conscious approach to work/life balance in order to keep this all straight.

My management principles
---

**A good manager is a gardener.** Every individual on my team has different needs and strengths, and looks different when they are flourishing. I cannot *"drive"* your success with my own effort. No amount of cajoling, talking, or hand wringing will make a tomato plant grow. But the plant will grow on its own, if the gardener provides the right environment. Every plant needs different amounts of water, the right soil pH, specific amounts of sunlight, and every person has different needs, too.

**Community ennobles every participant.** Our team is a community. Our friendships and collaboration make us stronger. We make our most important decisions in a collaborative and fully transparent way.

**True mastery looks like play.** Learners need all their focus to do a thing. Experienced practitioners can enter into a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Masters can enjoy the whole experience. More on this later.

**People come first.** If you ever have a personal issue or concern, stop work immediately and let's talk. *You as a human being are more important than any project.*

My promises to you
---

I promise to foster an environment characterized by:

* Mutual respect and trust.
* Enabling and celebrating each others' victories.
* A sense of play.

As your manager:

* **I will always have your back.** That does not mean I will always agree with you! It means that I will defend your person and your motives, even when I disagree.
* **I will take punches for you.** I am happy to jump in front of particularly frustrating bureaucracy, or difficult colleagues and superiors. I'm here to make your (working) life easier!
* **I will proactively seek to help you succeed**, in both your career and personal development.
* **I will constantly try to improve our efficiency and effectiveness**, both as individuals and as a team. 
* **I will operate with maximum transparency**. I will always give you all the relevant information I have. People make the best decisions when they have the most context.
* **I, and my decisions, are an open book.** Please never hesitate to ask me questions, *especially* about decisions that seem like they come from a "black box".
* **I will say "yes" whenever possible.** In return, I expect you to trust that when I say "no", *it is for a good reason.* 


A Sense Of Play
---

In my martial arts studies I've met all sorts of "masters." I'll tell you about the highest level practitioner I've ever encountered.

His name is Kacem Zoughari, and he is arguably the world's foremost expert on Bujinkan Ninjutsu. He came to give a masterclass in my area, and I went to watch. All of the black belts in Germany lined up and bowed while Kacem explained the importance of one of the first training stances in ninjutsu, which has you stand on one leg. To demonstrate, he asked all the black belts to attack him, first one at a time, then in pairs and threes, and eventually with weapons, while he defended from one leg position. As the first black belt moved in, Kacem suddenly shouted "stop! Something is wrong." We all stopped, and respectfully fell back to position. Was it a problem with our dojo? Were the weapons somehow incorrect? 

Kacem quietly walked over to his workout bag, pulled out a boom box, and pressed play. The room filled with the sound of American soul music as "Sugar pie honey" came on. Kacem walked calmy back to his place, resumed his stance, and gestured to the first black belt to begin the attack. He proceeded to kick the ass of every black belt in Germany, the whole time lightly dancing and singing along. As he went, he occasionally mimed a wedgie, or tweaked someone's nose. In short: **he played.**

Turns out, a real ninja master really does fight like the Ninja Turtles.

I've seen the same attitude in the best developers I've known, in the best leaders, performers, and athletes. **Great masters play.**


Practical stuff
===

Meetings and Work
---

**My working hours**
Mon-Wed-Fri: 9-17:00 CET
Tue-Thur: 12-20:00 CET
If I am physically in another timezone, these hours will adjust. Outside of these hours I am generally only available for life-and-limb or personal emergencies.

**Your working hours**
I don't mind or care when they are, exactly, but they should be predictable. Let me know about exceptions, and note them on your calendar.

**Rescheduling a meeting at the last minute is OK; leaving your team hanging is not.**

**Punctuality is not required**
Anytime within the first 5 minutes of a meeting is "on time" in my book. Please understand that I mean no disrespect when I show up 3 minutes late, myself.

**There is no dress code for 1:1 meetings.** If it's first thing in the morning, feel free to join the call in your PJs with your cup of coffee. I care about your brain, not your clothes.

**"At work" for us means "logged into chat."** You do not have to be *available* - you may have meetings, or coding time, and the chat application may be in Do Not Disturb mode. But you should be virtually present.

**Never drop a meeting on my calendar without separately communicating with me about it.**
Send an email, ask in chat, mention it in a meeting, whatever. I will confirm that I can make the time. The "accepted" status on the meeting alone is almost meaningless. The same goes for suggested reschedules, or cancellations.

**You are my highest priority**. If you need my help, please ping me through any channel and I will make the time.

**Please proactively block off coding time in your calendar**, so I don't interrupt your real work with my meetings. Writing code - writing anything, really - requires large blocks of focused time!

**Recurring meetings on the calendar are reminders to *have* the meeting**. They will often be rescheduled as necessary.

Communication
---

* **I prefer open and frank communication at all times.** We can talk about anything at all. When problems arise I need you to let me know as clearly and quickly as possible.
* **I am a big, bombastic personality.** If you ever feel uncomfortable with me, or my behavior, please let me know. I am happy to tone it down for you.
* **I often ask "why."** This isn't a challenge to your decision, it's an honest question! I want to understand the thought process behind your decisions or beliefs.
* **Different communication tools are suited for different kinds of communication.** 
** Chat (IRC, Slack, MSTeams) is the default, but we can switch modes when appropriate.
** Email and digital text are great for lists (like this one!), records, and precise factual communication. They are terrible for emotion, context, and human subjects.
** Sensitive and important subjects require non-verbal cues. That means in-person, video-conference, or audio (in order of preference).
* **Please enable video for our meetings whenever possible.** If you are in transit, or multi-tasking, it is not a good time for the meeting. Let's reschedule.
* **I'm big on work/life balance**. I do not expect you to respond outside of your usual working hours, and I typically won't, either. 
* **Social and work time are separate.** We will have lots of fun "team building" and "morale" time hanging out together. When we are having a beer is *the worst time* to ask about that promotion, or tell me about a project that went wrong. In social time, please do not bring up work with me, and don't let me bring it up with you.

1:1 Meetings and Feedback
---

I ambitiously schedule weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, so it's OK when a few of them fall off due to vacation, travel, timezones, etc. 

* **You can always ask me for an extra meeting about any subject you like.** 
* **The 1:1 meeting belongs to you.** I may have some things to bring up with you, but the overall agenda is controlled by *you*. 
* **The 1:1 meeting is private.** Unless I think you're in imminent personal or career danger, I will not share anything from our meetings.
* **I believe in frequent, honest, supportive feedback** - mostly because that's just how my brain works. I can't help thinking of improvements, other approaches, and common pitfalls. I will express them to you, not as requirements for you to follow, but as options to consider.
* **My feedback is *always* intended constructively**, and I try to deliver it that way. I hope you will do the same for me. I make mistakes and have lots of room for improvement. Please help me grow by giving me honest feedback when it occurs to you!


Performance and Success
===

  "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." -- Richard Feynman

The human brain is an extremely fallible thing. I don't trust mine. 

* **I will seek to rate your performance as objectively as possible.** 
* **I will communicate my expectations for your role as clearly as I can.**
* **I will keep running notes on what you've accomplished and learned this year**
I will share these notes with you in a Github repository, and we'll have them open on our 1:1 meetings. You can read my understanding of your year at any time, and feel free to submit PRs to correct me! *It's in both of our best interests that I have a great understanding of what a good job you're doing.*

Success for you means
---
* Taking ownership of your projects. There is no [somebody else's problem field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem) to cover parts of the project to which you aren't assigned. If the project is off track, or missing key information, and failing in some other way, it's up to you to try and correct it. If you're not sure how, or are blocked in any way - that's what I'm here for.
* Being honest about your own limitations and failures. By acknowledging them, you can adjust your approach for next time. There is nothing wrong with saying "I don't know", or "I'm not good at that yet." 
* Constantly trying, sometimes failing... and always seeking to improve and learn.

Success for me means
---
* A team of independent individuals who are growing, and having fun at work
* A strong personal connection to each member of my team. We don't have to be friends, but I have to know you and your personality.
* Receiving feedback, learning, and growing along with the team.


TL;DR
===
My team thrives on mutual respect, individual responsibility, and constant learning/improvement. The success of one member is a success for us all.

* People first!
* I will always have your back.
* Open, frank, constructive communication in both directions.
* I'm a resource to help you grow and develop, professionally, technically, and personally. Use me.
* It's OK not to know everything, it's OK to make mistakes. It's *not* OK to believe you *can't* understand, or *can't* do better next time.
* Have fun in your work. Play.

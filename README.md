Campbell Vertesi - the manager readme
===

This document is an introduction to me, as a person, as a manager, and as a colleague. It seems unfair to throw someone into a new situation with a manager, and expect them to just "figure it out as they go". I hope that this helps to make that experience a little easier.

If you have questions, suggestions, or if you just disagree with how I present myself here, please submit an Issue, Bug, or PR. I've never had me as a manager, so your feedback is very helpful!

Finally, this is not a hard and fast set of "rules." This document should set expectations, not define rigid requirements. The ultimate guide is the one we build over experience working together.


About Me
---

I'm a learning addict, and relatively stubborn. This means: 

* When I was a kid, and computer games didn't work... I just beat my head against the problem until I figured out memory management, DOS drivers, and whatever else was necessary. This has basically been my path to success as a self-taught computer repair guy, business owner, sysadmin, web frontend developer, web backend developer, and manager. In chronological order, you've basically just read my last 20 years of work history.
* My interests are cumulative. I founded my first business when I was 18, and have owned several since then. I think the only one I really dropped was "Frontend developer." Detail is difficult for me; matching mockups just made me crazy. 
* My interests are extremely diverse. My (completed) university training is as an opera singer. I also do Tae Kwon-Do, Bujinkan ninjutsu, rubix cubes, video games, hiking, camping, fencing badminton, and a thousand other things I can't think of right now.
* I believe that every field of human endeavor has passion at its core, and I seek to find the passion in everything I do. I still haven't found it in math, but I'm still looking!

I have one kid (so far). His name is Perry, born in 2015, and (so far) he's into music, building things, and fixing things, just like his dad. I also have an incredible wife, who runs our classical music entertainment company full-time. That's a traveling show of 6 awesome opera singers singing solo and group numbers, where you can cheer, sing along, dance, and generally have a good time. Sometimes I perform, too. Working as and with artists has given me the chops to handle anything you can throw at me!

My philosophy
---

**I believe that a good leader is the head of their wolf pack.** Pack members think and operate individually, but chase the biggest prey by working together. My pack thrives on:

* Mutual respect and trust.
* Enabling and celebrating each others' victories.
* A sense of play.

As your pack leader:

* **I will always have your back.** That does not mean I will always agree with you! It means that I will defend your person and your motives in every situation.
* **I will take punches for you.** I am happy to jump in front of particularly frustrating bureaucracy, or difficult colleagues and superiors. I'm here to make your (working) life easier!
* **I will proactively try to help you succeed**, both inside and outside the organization.
* **I will constantly try to improve our efficiency and effectiveness**, both as individuals and as a team. 
* **I will support you in your career and personal development.**
* **I should not be the best developer in the pack**. If any of my reports is not better than me, I am failing in an important aspect of my job.

I believe in open collaboration in teams. That entails a few promises:

* **You are an intelligent individual.** I will not micro-manage your work or decisions.
* **People make the best decisions when they have the most context.** I will always give you all the relevant information I have. 
* **I, and my decisions, are an open book.** Please never hesitate to ask me questions, *especially* about decisions that seem like they come from a "black box".
* **I will not lie to you, or anyone else.**
* **I will not violate your secrets.** If a secret comes into conflict with the other rules, I will tell you directly that I cannot go into more detail because it is a secret.
* **I will say "yes" whenever possible.** In return, I expect you to trust that when I say "no", *it is for a good reason.* 

There is a sense of honor in a wolf pack, which can be challenging for some people to live up to. Let me make it a bit easier: your honor rests on your honesty and willingness to collaborate. *It does not rest on your accuracy, your technical level, or your success.*  

**I believe that everyone makes mistakes.** I hope you do, too. Mistakes are fine, as long as you try to recognize, learn, and improve from them. 

**I believe in systems, rather than goals.** Find a pattern of working that puts you in a better position, and you'll blow by the goal. The system is the important part.

**I believe that community ennobles every participant.**

**I believe that true mastery means the ability to play in a discipline.**


A Sense Of Play
---
In my martial arts studies I've met all sorts of "masters." I'll tell you about the highest level practitioner I've ever encountered, though.

His name is Kacem Zoughari, and he is arguably the world's foremost expert on Bujinkan Ninjutsu. He came to give a masterclass in my area, and I went to watch. Kacem arrived, laughing and joking, and set up the workshop. All of the black belts in Germany lined up and bowed, and we exchanged the formal greetings. Then Kacem explained about the importance of one of the first training stances in ninjutsu, which has you stand on one leg. He asked all the black belts to attack him, first one at a time, then in pairs and threes, while he stayed in that one legged position. As the first blackbelt moved in, Kacem suddenly shouted "stop! Something is wrong." We all stopped, fell back to position. Was it a problem with our dojo? Were the weapons somehow incorrect? 

Kacem quietly walked over to his workout bag, pulled out a boom box, and pressed play. The room filled with the sound of American soul music as "Sugar pie honeey" came on. Kacem resumed his position, raised one leg, and gestured to the first black belt to begin the attack. He proceeded to kick the ass of every black belt in Germany, the whole time lightly shimmying and singing along. He occasionally mimed a wedgie, or sticking his finger in one ear. In short: he played, as he demonstrated his mastery.

I was reminded of the fight scenes from the Ninja Turtles movies.


The truth is, you have reached mastery when it is play. When it is fun to do. And that sense is attainable by all of us.

Meetings and Work
---

* My working hours are typically 9 - 5, Central European Time. If I am physically in another timezone, these hours will adjust.  These periods are noted on my calendar.
* Rescheduling a meeting at the last minute is OK; leaving your team hanging is not.
* My schedule is often crazy, split across timezones and travel legs. Our recurring meetings are reminders to *have* the meeting - they will often be rescheduled.
* Punctuality is not required - anytime in the first 5 minutes of a meeting is "on time" in my book. Please understand that I mean no disrespect when I show up 3 minutes late, myself.
* I expect my reports to have predictable work hours. I don't mind or care when they are, exactly, but they should follow a pattern which you communicate with me. Let me know about exceptions, and note them in your calendar.
* I normally schedule meetings as 50 minute time slots, rather than an hour. My brain needs cool-off and prep time between tasks!
* "At work" for all my reports means "logged into chat." Use whichever chat system is the norm on our team (IRC, Slack, or Teams). You do not have to be *available* - you may have meetings, or coding time, and the chat application may be in Do Not Disturb mode. But you should be virtually present. 
* **Never drop a meeting on my calendar without separately communicating with me about it.** This is partially respect, but also simply giving me the option to tell you personally if that is a good time. My "accepted" status on the meeting is almost meaningless.
* My calendar is often packed, but **the pack is my highest priority**. If you need my help, please ping me through any channel and I will make the time.
* Writing code - writing anything, really - requires large blocks of time. Please proactively block off days in your schedule, so I don't interrupt your real work with my meetings.

Communication
---

* **I prefer open and frank communication at all times.** We can talk about anything at all, but when problems arise I need you to let me know as clearly and quickly as possible.
* **I am often a big, bombastic personality.** If you ever feel uncomfortable with me, or my behavior, please let me know. I am happy to tone it down for you.
* **I often ask "why."** This isn't a challenge to your decision, it's an honest question! I want to understand the thought process behind your code.
* **Different communication tools are suited for different kinds of communication.** Chat (IRC, Slack, Teams) is the default, but we can switch modes when appropriate.
* Email and digital text are great for lists (like this one!), records, and precise factual communication. They are terrible for emotion, context, and human subjects.
* Sensitive and important subjects require non-verbal cues. That means in-person, video-conference, or audio (in order of preference). 
* **I'm big on work/life balance**. I do not expect you to respond outside of your usual working hours, and I typically don't, either. 
* **Don't bother pinging me on Skype for Business.** It's an incompatible, unreliable application. I don't leave it running, don't check the messages, and don't respond there. Use Teams, email, Signal, SMS, phone, or carrier pigeon.
* **I try to make clear, separate contexts for social and work time.** In social time, please do not bring up work matters with me. When we are having a beer together is *the worst time* to ask about that promotion, or tell me about the project that went wrong. This is a difficult rule to keep, so if we end up on a work topic while we are socializing, please help me call it out and move the conversation to a more appropriate time.

One on Ones and Feedback
---

I ambitiously schedule weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, so it's OK when a few of them fall off due to vacation, travel, timezones, etc. You can always ask me for a 1:1 meeting about any subject you like. My 1:1s are casual chats. We can talk about anything under the sun, but I will explicitly ask you "how was your week,"  "what have you been working on," and "is anything bothering you?"

I believe in frequent, honest, supportive feedback - mostly because that's just how my brain works. I can't help thinking of improvements, other approaches, and common pitfalls. I will express them to you, not as requirements for you to follow, but as options to consider. My feedback is *always* meant constructively, and I try to deliver it that way. I hope you will do the same for me. I make mistakes and have lots of room for improvement, just like everyone else. Please help me grow by giving me honest feedback when it occurs to you!

Performance
---

"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." -- Richard Feynman

The human brain is an extremely fallible thing. I don't trust mine. I will seek ways to rate your performance as objectively as possible, despite our personal relationship. I will communicate my expectations for your role as clearly as I can. I like to keep running notes on what a person has accomplished or tried this year, as a handy reference for when I need to consider a performance review. I wll share those notes with you whenever possible. You can ask me how you're doing at any time, and feel free to correct me! It's up to you to make sure I have a great understanding of where you are.

Success
---

Success for me means:
* A team of independent individuals who are growing, and having fun at work
* A strong personal connection to each member of my team. We don't have to be friends, but I have to know you and your personality.
* Receiving feedback, learning, and growing along with the team.

Success for you means:
* Taking ownership of your projects. There is no "somebody else's problem field" to cover parts of the project to which you aren't assigned. If the project is off track, or missing key information, and failing in some other way, it's up to you to try and correct it. If you're not sure how, or are blocked in any way - that's what I'm here for.
* Being honest about your own limitations and failures. By acknowledging them, you can compensate for them. There is nothing wrong with saying "I don't know", or "I'm not good at that yet." 
* Trying, sometimes failing, and always seeking to improve and learn.


TL;DR
---
My wolf pack thrives on mutual respect, individual responsibility, and constant learning/improvement. The success of one member, is a success for us all.

* I will always have your back.
* Open, frank, constructive communication in both directions.
* I'm a resource to help you grow and develop, professionally, technically, and personally. Use me.
* It's OK not to know everything, it's OK to make mistakes. It's *not* OK to believe you *can't* understand, or *can't* do better next time.
* 1:1 meetings are **your time** to discuss whatever concerns you.
* Have fun in your work. Play.

Campbell Vertesi - the manager readme
===

This document is an introduction to me, as a person, as a manager, and as a colleague. It seems unfair to throw someone into a new situation with a manager, and expect them to just "figure it out as they go". I hope that this helps to make that experience a little easier.

If you have questions, suggestions, or if you just disagree with how I present myself here, please submit an Issue, Bug, or PR. I've never had me as a manager, so your feedback is very helpful!

Finally, this is not a hard and fast set of "rules." This document should set expectations, not define rigid requirements. The ultimate guide is the one we build over experience working together.


Me as a human
---

I'm a learning addict, and relatively stubborn. This means: 

* When I was a kid, and computer games didn't work... I just beat my head against the problem until I figured out memory management, DOS drivers, and whatever else was necessary. This has basically been my path to success as a self-taught computer repair guy, business owner, sysadmin, web frontend developer, web backend developer, and manager.
* My interests are cumulative. I founded my first business when I was 18, and have owned several since then. Every one came out of a passion area for me.
* My interests are extremely diverse. I've had university training in philosophy, sociology, and classical music. I also enjoy Tae Kwon-Do, Bujinkan ninjutsu, rubix cubes, video games, hiking, camping, fencing badminton, and a thousand other things I can't think of right now.
* I believe that every field of human endeavor has passion at its core, and I seek to find the passion in everything I do. (I haven't found it in math yet, but I'm still looking!)

I have a son named Perry, born in 2015. So far, he's into music, building things, and fixing things, just like his dad. I have an incredible wife, who runs our classical music entertainment company ([The Cast](https://thecastmusic.com/)) full-time. That's a traveling show of 6 awesome opera singers singing solo and group numbers, where you can cheer, sing along, dance, and generally have a good time. Sometimes I perform, too (university in classical music, remember?).

My management philosophy
---

**I believe that a good manager is a gardener.** Every individual on my team has different needs and strengths, and looks different when they are flourishing. I cannot *drive* your success with my own effort. No amount of cajoling, talking, or hand wringing will make a tomato plant grow. But the plant will grow on its own, if the gardener just works to provide the right environment. Every plant needs different amounts of water, the right soil pH, specific amounts of sunlight. Similarly, with the right opportunities, support,  and latitude, each individual will flourish on their own. A good gardener does the back-breaking work of creating and maintaining the right environment for each plant, and *allows* the plants to flourish.

**I believe that everyone makes mistakes.** I hope you make lots of mistakes, and get really good at learning from them. I make plenty myself.

**I believe in systems, rather than goals.** Find a pattern of working that puts you in a better position to succeed, and success will come on its own. The system is the important part.

**I believe that community ennobles every participant.** Our team is a community. Our friendships and collaboration make us stronger.

**I believe that true mastery means the ability to play in a discipline.**

**I believe that people come first.** If you ever have a personal issue or concern, stop work immediately and let me know. You as a human being are more important than any project.

My promises to you
---

I promise to foster an environment characterized by:

* Mutual respect and trust.
* Enabling and celebrating each others' victories.
* A sense of play.

As your manager, I promise:

* **I will always have your back.** That does not mean I will always agree with you! It means that I will defend your person and your motives, though.
* **I will take punches for you.** I am happy to jump in front of particularly frustrating bureaucracy, or difficult colleagues and superiors. I'm here to make your (working) life easier!
* **I will proactively seek to help you succeed**, in both your career and personal development.
* **I will constantly try to improve our efficiency and effectiveness**, both as individuals and as a team. 
* **I will behave with maximum transparency**. 
* **I will always give you all the relevant information I have.** People make the best decisions when they have the most context.
* **I, and my decisions, are an open book.** Please never hesitate to ask me questions, *especially* about decisions that seem like they come from a "black box".
* **I will not violate your secrets.** If a secret comes into conflict with the other rules, I will tell you directly that I cannot go into more detail because it is a secret.
* **I will say "yes" whenever possible.** In return, I expect you to trust that when I say "no", *it is for a good reason.* 


A Sense Of Play
---

In my martial arts studies I've met all sorts of "masters." I'll tell you about the highest level practitioner I've ever encountered.

His name is Kacem Zoughari, and he is arguably the world's foremost expert on Bujinkan Ninjutsu. He came to give a masterclass in my area, and I went to watch. Kacem arrived, laughing and joking, and set up the workshop. All of the black belts in Germany lined up and bowed, and Kacem explained the importance of one of the first training stances in ninjutsu, which has you stand on one leg. To demonstrate, he asked all the black belts to attack him, first one at a time, then in pairs and threes, and eventually with weapons, while he stayed in that one legged position. As the first black belt moved in, Kacem suddenly shouted "stop! Something is wrong." We all stopped, and respectfully fell back to position. Was it a problem with our dojo? Were the weapons somehow incorrect? 

Kacem quietly walked over to his workout bag, pulled out a boom box, and pressed play. The room filled with the sound of American soul music as "Sugar pie honey" came on. Kacem resumed his position, raised one leg, and gestured to the first black belt to begin the attack. He proceeded to kick the ass of every black belt in Germany, the whole time lightly dancing and humming along. As he went, he occasionally mimed a wedgie, or tweaked someone's nose. In short: **he played.**

I was reminded of the fight scenes from the Ninja Turtles movies.

I've seen the same attitude in the best developers I've known, in the best leaders, performers, and athletes. **Great masters play.**


Practical stuff
===

Meetings and Work
---

* **My working hours are normally 9 - 5, Central European Time.** If I am physically in another timezone, these hours will adjust.  These periods are noted on my calendar.
* **I expect you to have predictable work hours, too.** I don't mind or care when they are, exactly, but they should be predictable. Let me know about exceptions, and note them on your calendar.
* **Rescheduling a meeting at the last minute is OK; leaving your team hanging is not.**
* **Punctuality is not required** - anytime within the first 5 minutes of a meeting is "on time" in my book. Please understand that I mean no disrespect when I show up 3 minutes late, myself.
* **There is no dress code for 1:1 meetings.** If it's first thing in the morning, feel free to meet in your PJs with your cup of coffee. I care about your brain, not your clothes.
* **"At work" for us means "logged into chat."** You do not have to be *available* - you may have meetings, or coding time, and the chat application may be in Do Not Disturb mode. But you should be virtually present.
* **Never drop a meeting on my calendar without separately communicating with me about it.** Send an email, ask in chat, mention it in a meeting, whatever. I will confirm that I can make the time. The "accepted" status on the meeting alone is almost meaningless. The same goes for suggested reschedules, or cancellations.
* My calendar is often packed, but **my team is my highest priority**. If you need my help, please ping me through any channel and I will make the time.
* Writing code - writing anything, really - requires large blocks of time. **Please proactively block off coding time in your calendar**, so I don't interrupt your real work with my meetings.
* **Recurring meetings on the calendar are reminders to *have* the meeting**. They will often be rescheduled as necessary.

Communication
---

* **I prefer open and frank communication at all times.** We can talk about anything at all, but when problems arise I need you to let me know as clearly and quickly as possible.
* **I am a big, bombastic personality.** If you ever feel uncomfortable with me, or my behavior, please let me know. I am happy to tone it down for you.
* **I often ask "why."** This isn't a challenge to your decision, it's an honest question! I want to understand the thought process behind your code.
* **Different communication tools are suited for different kinds of communication.** 
** Chat (IRC, Slack, MSTeams) is the default, but we can switch modes when appropriate.
** Email and digital text are great for lists (like this one!), records, and precise factual communication. They are terrible for emotion, context, and human subjects.
** Sensitive and important subjects require non-verbal cues. That means in-person, video-conference, or audio (in order of preference).
* **Please enable video for our meetings whenever possible.** If you are in transit, or multi-tasking, it is not a good time for the meeting. Let's reschedule.
* **I'm big on work/life balance**. I do not expect you to respond outside of your usual working hours, and I typically don't, either. 
* **Don't bother pinging me on Skype for Business.** I don't leave it running, don't check the messages, and don't respond there. Use Teams, email, Signal, SMS, phone, or carrier pigeon.
* **Social and work time are separate.** We will have lots of fun "team building" and "morale" time hanging out together. When we are having a beer is *the worst time* to ask about that promotion, or tell me about a project that went wrong. In social time, please do not bring up work with me.

1:1 Meetings and Feedback
---

I ambitiously schedule weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, so it's OK when a few of them fall off due to vacation, travel, timezones, etc. 

* **You can always ask me for a 1:1 meeting about any subject you like.** 
* **The 1:1 meeting belongs to you.** I may have some things to bring up with you, but the overall agenda is controlled by *you*. We can talk about anything you want.
* **The 1:1 meeting is private.** Unless I think you're in imminent physical or career danger, I will not share anything from our meetings.
* **I believe in frequent, honest, supportive feedback** - mostly because that's just how my brain works. I can't help thinking of improvements, other approaches, and common pitfalls. I will express them to you, not as requirements for you to follow, but as options to consider.
* **My feedback is *always* intended constructively**, and I try to deliver it that way. I hope you will do the same for me. I make mistakes and have lots of room for improvement. Please help me grow by giving me honest feedback when it occurs to you!

Performance and Success
===

  "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." -- Richard Feynman

The human brain is an extremely fallible thing. I don't trust mine. 

* **I will seek to rate your performance as objectively as possible**, despite our personal relationship. 
* **I will communicate my expectations for your role as clearly as I can.**
* **I will keep running notes on what you've accomplished and learned this year**, as a handy reference for when I need to consider a performance review. I wll share those notes with you in a Github repository. You can read my understanding of your year at any time, and feel free to submit PRs to correct me! *It's in both of our best interests that I have a great understanding of where you are.*

Success for you means
---
* Taking ownership of your projects. There is no [somebody else's problem field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem) to cover parts of the project to which you aren't assigned. If the project is off track, or missing key information, and failing in some other way, it's up to you to try and correct it. If you're not sure how, or are blocked in any way - that's what I'm here for.
* Being honest about your own limitations and failures. By acknowledging them, you can adjust your approach for next time. There is nothing wrong with saying "I don't know", or "I'm not good at that yet." 
* Constantly trying, sometimes failing... and always seeking to improve and learn.

Success for me means
---
* A team of independent individuals who are growing, and having fun at work
* A strong personal connection to each member of my team. We don't have to be friends, but I have to know you and your personality.
* Receiving feedback, learning, and growing along with the team.


TL;DR
===
My team thrives on mutual respect, individual responsibility, and constant learning/improvement. The success of one member is a success for us all.

* I will always have your back.
* Open, frank, constructive communication in both directions.
* I'm a resource to help you grow and develop, professionally, technically, and personally. Use me.
* It's OK not to know everything, it's OK to make mistakes. It's *not* OK to believe you *can't* understand, or *can't* do better next time.
* 1:1 meetings are **your time** to discuss whatever concerns you.
* Have fun in your work. Play.
